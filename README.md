# A genetic Algorithm Solution for Weekly Course Timetabling Problem

Genetic Algirthms are the method for finding enough good solutions of the problems which cannot be solved by standard method named NP-Hard problems. Although it does not guaranty the best solution, we can find relatively enough good solutions on most engineering problems within that method [1]. 

Educational instuties such as high schools universities use weekly course timetabling to use all sources in the optimum way. To make an optimum weekly timetable is such an example of HP-Hard problem which cannot be solved in any brutal force method which check every single probabilities. In this repository, we provided a solution of that problem using Genetic Algorithm which tries to minimize determined fitness function which that function is a sort of measurement of how the timetable is optimum.
